# Frame It - by @farfi
A frame that lets Farcaster users to easily earn yield via top-tier DeFi protocols on Arbitrum (e.g., Aave, Pendle, etc.).
Users can conveniently take advantage of safe yet lucrative yield opportunities offered on Arbitrum without leaving Warpcast.
Using the FarFi frame users can (1) Discover and learn about high-yield, high TVL investment opportunities and (2) Invest with a simple click. 

The first iteration of the FarFi frame allows Farcaster users to invest in fixed yield strategies via Pendle.
The user flow for using the frame is straightforward â†’ 

(1) Choose from the 3 investment options

(2) Enter the amount you want to invest and approve transaction.

Our goal is to become a native DeFi layer built on top of Farcaster.
We believe decentralized finance coupled with a decentralized social layer will unlock innovative ways to manage both ones financial and social assets.
As Arbitrum is the leading Layer 2 with the most active DeFi ecosystem, we are excited to showcase further utility by integrating more features around liquidity provision,
lending, liquid restaking, derivatives, etc. all made available through frames.
